# Kotlin Learning
## General on Kotlin
* Statically typed like Java, unlike dynamically typed language such as JRuby
 
	Pros:    
	    1. type is known at compile time, complier can do validation on methods and fields
        2. mispelled names can be detected at compile time instead of run time

* Type inference: `val a = 1`
* Support `nullable` types - reliable code, detecting possible null at compile time
* Support `function` types
